🧑‍💻 I’m Guille, a Computer Engineer at Telefónica Tech with experience developing and building blockchain-based solutions and applications for a wide range of sectors

💻 I am always learning something new, and trying to put them into practice. These days I'm studying the possibilities of ZKP as well as other things like AI.

🎤 In order to contribute to the space, I like to give talks [(here is my last talk)](https://guillermovahi.dev/talks/what-is-that-in-blockchain) and teach other people what I've done or what I've learned. 

🧪 Here you'll find some of the public projects that I've done in the past, and other stuff during my time on 42 Madrid.
